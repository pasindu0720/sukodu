## 🎮 How to Play

### Basic Controls

#### Mouse Controls:
1. **Click a cell** to select it (highlighted in color)
2. **Click number buttons** (1-9) to place a number
3. **Click "Clear"** to remove a number from selected cell

#### Keyboard Controls:
- **1-9 keys** - Place number in selected cell
- **0 or Delete/Backspace** - Clear selected cell
- **Mouse click** - Select different cell

### Game Buttons

| Button | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Numbers 1-9** | Enter number in selected cell |
| **Clear** | Remove number from selected cell |
| **Reset** | Reset puzzle to original state |
| **Check** | Verify if solution is correct |
| **Dark/Light** | Toggle between color themes |
| **Hint** | Get a hint for an empty cell |
| **Save** | Save current game progress |
| **Load** | Load previously saved game |

### Game Rules

1. **Fill the 9×9 grid** so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 boxes contains the digits 1-9
2. **No repetition** - Each number can appear only once in each row, column, and 3×3 box
3. **Pre-filled cells** (shown in darker color) cannot be modified
4. **Invalid moves** will show an error message

### Tips & Strategies

- 🎯 **Start with easiest** - Fill in cells where only one number is possible
- 🔍 **Process of elimination** - Look at rows, columns, and boxes together
- 💡 **Use hints sparingly** - Try to solve as much as possible yourself
- ⏱️ **No time limit** - Take your time and think strategically
- 💾 **Save your progress** - Come back to difficult puzzles later

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Algorithm: Backtracking

The solver uses a **recursive backtracking algorithm**:

1. Find an empty cell (value = 0)
2. Try numbers 1-9 in that cell
3. Check if the number is valid (row, column, 3×3 box rules)
4. If valid, place number and recursively solve next cell
5. If stuck, backtrack and try different number
6. Repeat until solution found or all possibilities exhausted

**Time Complexity:** O(9^(n*n)) worst case, where n=9
**Space Complexity:** O(n*n) for the grid storage

### Data Structures

- **Grid:** 2D list (9x9) - `[[int]]`
- **Original:** Copy of initial puzzle - `[[int]]`
- **Cells:** Dictionary mapping (row, col) to tkinter widgets

### Validation Logic

A number is valid at position (row, col) if:
```python
✓ Not present in the same row
✓ Not present in the same column
✓ Not present in the same 3×3 box
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### **Issue 1: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tkinter'**

**Solution (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

**Solution (macOS):**
```bash
brew install python-tk
```

**Solution (Windows):**
Reinstall Python and ensure "tcl/tk and IDLE" is checked during installation.

---

#### **Issue 2: Application doesn't start / No window appears**

**Check:**
1. Ensure you're running `main.py`, not individual modules
2. Verify Python version: `python --version` (must be 3.7+)
3. Check for error messages in terminal

**Fix:**
```bash
python main.py 2>&1 | tee error.log
```
This will save errors to `error.log` for debugging.

---

#### **Issue 3: "NameError: name 'grid' is not defined"**

**Cause:** Files are not properly connected

**Solution:**
1. Ensure `main.py` exists and imports all modules
2. Run `python main.py`, not `python gui.py`
3. Check that engine.py defines `self.grid` in the class

---

#### **Issue 4: Numbers appear but validation doesn't work**

**Check:**
- Engine's `possible()` method is being called
- Grid is being updated correctly
- No conflicting global variables

**Debug:**
Add print statements in `possible()` method to verify it's being called.

---

#### **Issue 5: Save/Load doesn't work**

**Possible causes:**
1. No write permissions in directory
2. JSON file corrupted

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if file is created
ls -la sudoku_save.json

# Delete corrupted file
rm sudoku_save.json

# Try saving again
```

---

#### **Issue 6: Dark mode doesn't apply properly**

**Solution:**
Click the "Dark/Light" button twice to refresh the theme properly.
